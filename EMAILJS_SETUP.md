   - **Other**: You can also use other providers like Yahoo, etc.

## Step 5: Update Environment Variables
Edit the `.env` file in your project root with your actual values:

```env
VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_actual_service_id
VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your_actual_template_id
VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_actual_public_key
```

## Step 6: Test the Form
1. Restart your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Fill out the contact form on your website
3. Check your email (office.jaimedelacruziii@gmail.com) for the message

## Important Notes:
- EmailJS free plan allows 200 emails per month
- All emails will be sent to: office.jaimedelacruziii@gmail.com
- The form collects: name, email, subject, and message
- Users will see success/error messages after submission
- Make sure to add `.env` to your `.gitignore` to keep your keys secure

## Troubleshooting:
- If emails aren't being received, check your spam folder
- Verify all environment variables are set correctly
- Make sure the EmailJS service is active in your dashboard
- Check the browser console for any error messages
