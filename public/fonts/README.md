Add your Brick Sans font files here.

Expected filenames (update if your filenames differ, then adjust src/styles/globals.css accordingly):
- BrickSans-Variable.woff2 (normal)
- BrickSans-Italic-Variable.woff2 (italic)

These are referenced by @font-face in src/styles/globals.css so the Tailwind class `font-brick` works.
